# Assembly mips homeworks
This is a series of homework related to the "Architetture degli elaboratori" course at Sapienza.

## What the exercises are all about?
- The first exercise requires to compute the last k sum of integers where 0 < k < 20
- The second exercise requires to create a program to simulate the Othello-Reversi game
- The third exercise requires to analyze and compute an arithmetic expression using binary trees
- The last exercise requires to implement a mips program which can create and manage a binary tree supporting insertion, extraction and search of nodes
